Building from source
====================

Build Library
-------------

We are using CocoaPods for external libraries dependencies and their installation. You have to install CocoaPods plugin and use it to install external libraries we depend on. 
 
To install CocoaPods on your Mac type: 

	$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods

To install libraries execute command in the same directory as 'Podfile' file:

	$ pod install

To compile the library you should use `syncano-ios.xcworkspace` (and run `pod install` on `Podfile` in the same directory). To compile Demo project using the library, use `SyncanoDemo.xcworkspace` and a `Podfile` there. To use project with installed libraries always open project with `.xcworkspace` file, not `.xcodeproj`!

Modification
------------

To add external library dependency just edit 'Podfile' in main directory and type:

	pod 'library name' 

To remove external library just remove line with this library in 'Podfile', save it and execute command:

	$ pod install

 Documentation and further information on cocoapods available: http://cocoapods.org/

 Documentation
 -------------

 Appledoc documentation can be generated by building a `Documentation` target in `syncano-ios.xcworkspace`. Docs will be in `Syncano-Docs` directory and will be installed to Xcode documentation, too. In case something is wrong, logs are put into `appledoc.log` file. Before that `appledoc` should be installed, available at https://github.com/tomaz/appledoc/

 For writing documentation, it is recommended to use `VVDocumenter` XCode plugin (https://github.com/onevcat/VVDocumenter-Xcode). It makes writing correctly structured documentation a little easier. Simply place cursor above method/class/anything you wish to describe, and type `///` to generate a documentation template snippet for that item.
